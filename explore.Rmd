# Assignment 2 Script

## First download and extract data

In this case the data is delivered in a zip format, so we will save the archive to a temporary file.

```{r}
temp <- tempfile()
fileUrl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip"
download.file(fileUrl, temp, method="curl")
```

Display the first 10 lines of the file to see how it should be loaded.

```{r}
con <- file(unzip(temp, "household_power_consumption.txt"),"r")
readLines(con,n=10)
close(con)
```

Now we know the table has ";" as a delim.

```{r}
consumption <- read.table(unzip(temp, "household_power_consumption.txt"), header=TRUE, sep=";", na.strings="?")
head(consumption)
```

The data is now loaded into a dataframe.

### Convert Date/Time columns to R Date and Time classes

```{r}
library(dplyr)

consumption %>% mutate(Date=as.Date(Date), Time=strptime(Time,"%H:%M:%S"))
head(consumption)
```
